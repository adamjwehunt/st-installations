# Case study for Strong Tower Installations 

## Overview

Strong Tower Installations is a beautifully designed website that offers users an intuitive interface to explore the services provided by a local tech services company. The website is built using Vue.js and Sanity.io.

The main goal of the project was to create a website that not only showcased the services provided by the company, but also make it easy for potential customers to reach out and communicate their needs. 

The website was designed in close consultation with the client, focusing on creating an attractive user interface that reflected the desired designs and specifications. The owner also expressed the need for the ability to update content on the site, which led to the decision to integrate Sanity.io, a powerful content management system.

## Site Content

The website is divided into several sections including Home, Services, About Us, FAQs, Testimonials, and Contact. Each section provides different information about the company and its services.

## Customization & Updating Content

The website uses Sanity.io as its content management system, giving the owner the ability to modify and update the content as needed. This feature was specifically requested by the owner to ensure that the website could remain up-to-date with the latest information about the company and its services. 

## Result

Strong Tower Installations was very pleased with the final result. The website serves as a simple landing page for the company, showcasing its services and facilitating customer contact. The beautiful UI design and the ability to update content made it a perfect solution for the client's needs.
