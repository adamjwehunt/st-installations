                "Jessie is a true professional, honest, trustworthy, helpful & an expert at what he does. I feel so lucky I came across his name to help fix my ongoing problems with my home theatre system & network. I did a full scale remodel on my Cave Creek home in November 2016. The physical remodel on the home went through just fine without a hitch, but the system upgrade was nothing short of ongoing problems & issues. It included the following for over 18 months: some things working, nothing working, half working, and kinda working ever since. My original company contracted was Starpower a major retailer in North Scottsdale. After several follow up appointments and subsequent charges and the small fortune I paid them for the remodel- I finally cut them off after over a year of not resolving any ongoing, existing, or current issues. Jessie came & did a consultation to help with all the current problems. He was nothing short of a breath of fresh air. For the first time since 2016 I felt I finally found someone that could help fix all the issues I had been having- and he did not disappoint. He was out Friday & Saturday this week & I am finally enjoying my system pool side without any problems. He even charged me less than the original quote because he found an upgrade he recommended was not compatible with the part of my system that powers my patio. If you are considering his company for anything big or small feel free to have him pass you my personal number I can give him a 100% rating and truly feel that is not enough. 1 Happy Customer- Jim G.",
